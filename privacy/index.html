I&rsquo;m based in Montréal, which means our privacy practices are governed by laws in Canada.<br><br>If you have any questions about this Statement or any other privacy practice at The Moment, please contact me.<br></p><h2 class="mg-md static-h2">Collection</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a independant designers that works with people to create innovative solutions.<br><br>That means that a) I sometimes collect information that could identify you personally, and b) I sometimes use new and creative ways to connect and inspire people as clients, partners, or colleagues. I need the respect of my clients to be successful at both; I respect your privacy because we respect you. As partners. As clients. As people.<br><br>This policy statement is about any information that could identify you and how I collect, use, manage, retain, or dispose of your information throughout the course of our business.<br><br>I collect personal information. Sometimes Icollect it because you&rsquo;ve offered it, sometimes because of the projectsI am doing with a partner, or sometimes because of my social media presence.My collection, use, and retention of my information is purpose-driven, which means I only collect personal information for specific reasons—for example, a project.<br><br>WhenI collect any information that is personally identifiable I follow reasonable practices to make sure I take care of it for its entire lifecycle. I practice data-minimization and don&rsquo;t collect it if I don&rsquo;t need it. I de-identify personal information whenever I practicably can. I make sure that I am collecting from reputable sources who—when needed—also affirm privacy-positive practices.<br><br>If I&rsquo;ve collected personal information, I don&rsquo;t share or disclose it unless I need to. If I do need to share information that identifies you, I do so carefully and according to clear rules or contracts.<br><br>You may choose to withdraw consent for my collection of personal information that identifies you. This may affect the services I provide—such as sending newsletters or promotions. My collection and use patterns preserve your right to withdraw; I will not knowingly harm any relationship as a result of poor privacy practices.<br></p><h2 class="mg-md static-h2">Use</h2><p>When we use your information, we do so carefully. We use encryption on our laptops and other security tools (like locked doors and locked drawers) when we have control of information that identifies you. We use trusted partners for our operations. We have access-restricted offices and we have strict procedures for managing accounts. We maintain vigilance when contracting-out or sourcing professional services and require that our partners or suppliers respect your personal information the same way we do.<br><br>Our staff are trained on our privacy commitments. We follow up every once in a while to make sure our commitments are being met.<br></p><h2 class="mg-md">Retention, Disclosure, Disposal</h2><p>We don&rsquo;t keep your information if we don&rsquo;t have to, and if we do have to, we protect it. We encourage our partners to be careful about sharing personal information with us. We regularly affirm our commitment to careful management of personal information as part of our partnership agreements. That often includes compliance with professional regulation bodies of one kind or another. If you are curious, ask us which ones affect your information.<br><br>Sometimes we publish reports or study results. For example, we develop aggregate profiles that source qualitative and quantitative data. We take steps to de-identify personal information when we write and release these kinds of publications.<br><br>When we dispose of your personal information we do so with care.<br></p><h2 class="mg-md static-h2">Research</h2><p>We conduct customer research on behalf of clients and partners. When we do this we sign contracts that follow a clear set of practices, which are agreed upon before the research begins. These contracts determine how we gather, use, keep, and dispose of any information that could identify you. We guide our practices by taking a whole-person view: formally through projects with Research Ethics Boards when needed; and, informally through our commitment to building trusting relationships.<br><br>Sustaining trust means that we also take a long-term view of our interactions with your privacy. We take steps to be responsible stewards of any personal information about you we have, and we take steps to make sure any partners we work with follow the same approach we do when they manage any information on our behalf. We manage our information so that we can apply controls and make clear decisions about any information that might identify you. For example, we often run project-by-project engagements, which makes it easier to control and protect any personal information we may have gathered through our projects on any specific account. Building and maintaining trust takes time and effort; we spend time and effort making sure that you are informed about the consent you give when we work with you.<br></p><h2 class="mg-md static-h2">Marketing</h2><p>There are times when we use internet-based services to connect and engage with you. When we sign up for these services we choose ones that are well-established, or have demonstrated a similar commitment to privacy and security as we have.<br><br>Our marketing activities do use cookies and at times we will do analysis that involves IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. Sometimes these types of data are considered personal; sometimes they are not. If you are concerned about whether our practice may affect your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer directly for more details—this is the kind of thing that we like to deal with in person.<br><br>Speaking of in-person, we also conduct public events such as Customer or Human Centred Design research where we interact with you and on occasion create a record. Sometimes these are initiated by me, sometimes we run them on behalf of clients. Our clients engage us to learn about people&rsquo;s lives and what&rsquo;s important to them–what&rsquo;s important to you. We often use media to share the stories we hear, for example, uploading a video we capture, posting a blog that we author, sharing some pictures that we take, or other means to inspire others past the walls of the event.<br><br>When we host or run these kinds of activities we make an effort to let people know what we&rsquo;re doing and how you can make an informed decision concerning the content we capture and use. We also take steps at these kinds of events to help you understand what kinds of choices you might want to make about how much you share. We rely on trusting relationships to be effective in our area of expertise, and we always want to be responsive to your needs; please approach us directly at these events or indirectly afterwards to let us know if you have any questions, comments, or requests.<br><br>Finally, we also do pro-actively engage in connecting with existing clients and creating new clients. We use email, social media services, and other technology to create and maintain relationships. We respect your right to consent, and take steps to give you clear options that help your voice be heard.<br></p><h2 class="mg-md static-h2">Your Rights</h2><p>You have the right to know how I manage any information I have that could identify you. I'm committed to making sure your rights are respected.<br><br>We will update this privacy statement from time to time. Please contact me if you have any comments, questions, or concerns. Or compliments. I like those, too.<br><br>I am Benoit Meuiner and your privacy matters to me.<br></p></div></div></div></div><!-- bloc-7 END --><!-- footer-navigation --><div class="bloc bgc-princeton-orange l-bloc none social" id="footer-navigation"><div class="container bloc-lg footer-navigation-container"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-lg-12 offset-md-1 col-md-10 offset-sm-1 col-sm-10 col-10 offset-1 offset-lg-0"><h1 class="mg-md social-title float-lg-none h1-keep-in-touch-style">Keep in touch</h1></div></div><div class="row no-gutters footer-navigation-row"><div class="col-md-1 col-sm-1 col-2 col-lg-12 footer-navigation-column"><p class="footer-navigation-social-links"><a class="links-on-social" href="../contact/">Facebook</a>&nbsp; • &nbsp;<a class="links-on-social" href="../tksstrategicdesignsession/">Linkedin</a>&nbsp; • &nbsp;Instagram &nbsp;• &nbsp;Twitter &nbsp;• &nbsp;YouTube &nbsp; • &nbsp;TikTok</p><p class="footer-navigation-links"><a class="links-on-brand" href="../contact/">Contact</a>&nbsp; • &nbsp;<a class="links-on-brand" href="../tksstrategicdesignsession/">Privacy Policy</a></p></div></div></div></div><!-- footer-navigation END --><!-- footer --><div class="bloc bgc-outer-space d-bloc" id="footer"><div class="container bloc-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-7 col-sm-8 col-10 offset-1 offset-lg-0"><h2 class="mg-md text-sm-left text-left tc-white-smoke footer-title">How to contact me?</h2><p>You can say “hi” over on&nbsp;<a class="footer-link" href="http://www.twitter.com/bmeunier">Twitter&nbsp;</a><br>or send me an&nbsp;<a class="footer-link" href="mailto:ecrire@benoitmeunier.info">email</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for stopping by.<br></p></div></div></div></div><!-- footer END --></div><!-- Main container END -->  <script src="../js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js?1880"></script><script src="../js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js?1019"></script><script src="../js/blocs.min.js?1202"></script><script src="../js/lazysizes.min.js" defer></script><!-- Additional JS END -->  <!--  Google Tag Manager (noscript)  -->  <noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-5ZSSQ2Q" height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript>  <!--  End Google Tag Manager (noscript)  --><!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) --><noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-5ZSSQ2Q"height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript><!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) --><!-- Preloader --><div id="page-loading-blocs-notifaction" class="page-preloader"></div><!-- Preloader END --></body></html>
